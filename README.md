# SoundUML - Module For Modelio Open Source

This is a WIP module for Modelio Open Source, developed for a master's thesis whose goal is to build a foundational framework of principles designed to ground decisions when constructing (and subsequent utilization of) auditory notations. This work is based on the knowledge of music symbology and understanding of the semiotics of the audible field, combined with the insights provided by Daniel Moody in *The “Physics” of Notations: Toward a Scientific Basis for Constructing Visual Notations in Software Engineering*, together with the findings of other research and developed tools concerning these topics.

SoundUML is intended to validate these principles, and to test the feasability and usability of working with sound and voice when using UML (more specifically in Class and State Machine Diagrams).


The initial phase aims to use sound and TTS to read UML Class and State diagrams.

If the time constraints allow for it, a second phase would permit the editing of said diagrams with the usage of Google's Speech To Text API.
